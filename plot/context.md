# Meta-Prompt Exploration

## Give Context

### First

Hello there. I am a dungeon master for a small group of players, and I am trying to add some detail and consistency to the framework I have made for my campaign. I have run this campaign once before, and have a good idea of the general themes, characters, and plot. I would like to make it something more thoughtful, immersive, and complete.

To start with, I would like to make a "session zero" that I can use to test the way I design the rest of the sessions for the campaign, used to tease out the motives, affinities, and aversions of each player, and to help set their character arcs, as well as the plot line of their choice. It is a sort of "meta test" if you will.

I would like to copy and paste in a couple markdown files for you to read: first a rough summary of the setting in the context of our "session zero", and then some initial thoughts that I've come to about how I want to approach filling out the framework so far.

Could you please wait for me to upload this information? I then have some topics I'd like to discuss afterwards if you are willing.

### Next

### Prompts

I appreciate your help! With all this in mind, please address the following with as much detail and consistency as you can. Double check your work to make sure it matches with the backstory and general intent of our conversation, and please help point out anything I may not be aware of, or that may not make sense:
