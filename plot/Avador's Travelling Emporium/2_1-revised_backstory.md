# The Setting

Our campaign unfolds in a universe where "light travel" forms the backbone of the economy. The essential ingredients of this transportation method are dragon glass and a pearl produced by a specially bred oyster. The oyster pearls are particularly coveted, as they require skilled magical biologists and specific large-scale environments for successful cultivation.

The production process involves grinding the obsidian and pearl, blending them with other trace components, then fusing them together using antigravity spellwork in a magical furnace to form perfect spheres. These are the Light Stones, the devices enabling light travel.

The source of these pearls was once a secret, with many disastrous attempts made to reproduce them. Some claim to have successfully replicated the pearls, but they keep their methods hidden, hoping to create the ultimate "earth passing" Light Stone.

Our story starts after the release of a Light Stone manufacturing recipe that any common wizard can execute, along with the necessary antigravity spellwork. The creators of this recipe were a mad biologist, now quarantined due to a failed experiment, and a former tycoon turned planeswalker.

The biologist resides on a small island, seeking a cure for her escaped experiment and working towards an improved Light Network. As she delves deeper into her research, she inches closer to becoming a planeswalker herself.

# Avador's Expedition

Avador, our main NPC, is an explorer contracted to find new species of oysters for the biologist. A self-reliant tinkerer and explorer, Avador operates a massive lighthouse ship, a floating city block teeming with shops and people. Avador's ship is one of the few licensed to travel beyond the pocket dimension that makes up the campaign world, an endeavor backed by the government as they aim to expand their Light Network.

# Character Motivations

As the ship arrives, players should be swept up in the excitement of a traveling mall of wizard shops, akin to a fantastical version of Diagon Alley. Various crew members of the ship present opportunities for different motivations and roles, enticing players to potentially travel to new and alien worlds.

The ship has a reputation for shanghaiing people, adding an element of risk and intrigue.

# The Infection

The campaign world is plagued by a zombie infection, a byproduct of the mad biologist's immortality experiment. The infection is transmitted through blood and results in death within an hour, followed by reanimation. Only 1 in 20 infected retain their self-awareness, while the rest lose control, driven by a fungal infection to attack and infect others.

Those who retain control after infection are, in essence, immortal. They suffer from strong urges to harm other living beings and are drawn to the scent of CO2.

## The Fermentation Cult

A cult has formed around the infection, aiming for "living mummification." They infect willing (and sometimes unwilling) participants in the hope of achieving immortality. These rituals often result in the unintentional release of the zombie infection into nearby towns.

The cult uses an invention that isolates the infection to a specific body part. These "rebel bands" are used to control the spread of the infection and have become a common black market currency. These group rituals often turn into mass suicide events and should be handled carefully by the DM and the characters.
