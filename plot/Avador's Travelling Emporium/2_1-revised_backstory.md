# The Setting

Our campaign unfolds in a universe where "light travel" forms the backbone of the economy. The essential ingredients of this transportation method are dragon glass and a pearl produced by a specially bred oyster. The oyster pearls are particularly coveted, as they require skilled magical biologists and specific large-scale environments for successful cultivation.

The creators of this recipe were a mad biologist, now quarantined due to a failed experiment, and a former tycoon turned planeswalker.

The biologist resides on a small island, seeking a cure for her escaped experiment and working towards an improved Light Network. As she delves deeper into her research, she inches closer to becoming a planeswalker herself.

The production process of the spheres themselves involves grinding the obsidian and pearl, blending them with other trace components, and then fusing them together using antigravity spellwork within a magical furnace to form perfect spherical lenses. These are the Light Stones, the devices enabling light travel. They only work by line of sight through transparent materials, and are thus often anchored in lighthouse towers to place them as high as possible, but still maintain a path to the ground.

The source of these pearls was once a secret, with many disastrous and horrific attempts made to reproduce them. Some claim to have successfully replicated the pearls, but they kept their methods hidden, as a race is on to create an ultimate stone that enables travel through solid earth.

Our story starts after the public release of a Light Stone manufacturing recipe that any common wizard can execute, along with the necessary antigravity spellwork that is notoriously difficult to design.

This release by an anonymous source threatens to upset the current economy, and it caught everyone by surprise. There is no stopping the information now, and all the forces on the island are having to realign to this new democratization of their prized commodities.

# Avador's Expedition

Avador, our main NPC, is an explorer who was contracted to find new species of oysters for the biologist. A self-reliant tinkerer and explorer, Avador operates a massive lighthouse ship, a floating city block teeming with shops and people connected to the light network. Avador's ship is one of the few licensed to travel beyond the pocket dimension that makes up the campaign world, an endeavor backed by the government as they aim to expand their Light Network.

# Character Motivations

As the ship arrives, players should be swept up in the excitement of a fantastical traveling mall of wizard shops. Various crew members of the ship present representations of the places the ship has been as well as the politics involved in the communities. 

There are opportunities for different motivations and roles, enticing players to potentially travel to new and alien worlds, but truly taking them back to the beleaguered island of the campaign that the ship originates from.

The ship has a reputation for shanghaiing people, adding an element of risk and intrigue.

# The Infection

The campaign world the characters are whisked away to is plagued by a zombie infection, a byproduct of the mad biologist's immortality experiment. This is the same biologist known for first breeding the oysters used in light stone production before the public release.

The rogue infection she also produced is transmitted through blood and saliva and results in death within an hour, followed by reanimation. Only 1 in 20 infected retain their self-awareness, while the rest lose control, driven by a fungal infection to attack and infect others.

Those who retain control after infection are, in essence, immortal. They suffer from strong urges to harm other living beings and are drawn to the scent of CO2.

## The Fermentation Cult

A cult has formed around the infection, aiming for "living mummification." They infect willing (and sometimes unwilling) participants in the hope of achieving the ellusive self-aware infection, and thus achieve lichdom. These rituals often result in the unintentional release of the zombie infection into nearby towns. These group rituals are esentiall mass suicide events and should be handled delicately by the DM and the characters.

The cult is perpetuated by a common invention that was sold to the public to help alleviate the infection's spread. It isolates the infection on an individual to a specific body part, preventing the death and resurrection needed for the mind degredation.

They are bands of silver metal that are powered by a small amount of the wearer's own blood. Even though they were once used to control the infection, alternate uses have made them a common black market currency.
