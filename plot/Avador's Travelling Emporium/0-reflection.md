# Discussion

After an [initial idea](0-backstory.md) about how to set up a session zero feauting Avador's Travelling Emporium as the gateway into the campaign, [a generalized chat with ChatGPT 3.5](0-gpt_3_5-0.md) was begun as an initial exploration into basic structure of the setting, and potential refinements to current goals and plot design.

## Player Introductions

The initial promts produced some good things to be aware of when screening or introducing players or yourself as part of the campaign:
- Tone/Setting/Genre
- Themes
- PC Goals
- Respect, cooperation, willingness

## Player Profiling

I then attempted to ask about a profile of some player demographics that I could use to aim at potential desires.

- Exploration
- Combat
- Roleplaying
- Storytelling
- Problem-Solving
- Character Development
- Social Interaction
- Power Fantasy
- World-Building
- Immersion

At the same time I asked to consider potential needs I may be overlooking. The following is the list:

- Balanced encounters
- Character Arcs
- Variety: exploration, combat, puzzle, roleplay
- Pacing
- Open communication

## Making a Plan

I asked and had to specify my intent a couple times. I wanted a plan for how to conduct the initial episode, but it really wanted to do a pre-session pow-wow first. With some coaxing, the following came out, and seems like a good starting point

### The Plan

Certainly! Here's a plan for conducting the session itself as the "isekai's pilot episode" and introducing the players to the campaign narrative:

1. Opening Scene:
   - Set the stage with a vivid description of the surroundings and the magical ambiance of the wizard's shop.
   - Introduce the mysterious proprietor and have them welcome the characters to the shop, acknowledging their unique abilities and backstories.

2. Initial Encounter:
   - Present a minor conflict or problem that requires the characters' assistance, such as a magical artifact gone awry or a mischievous creature causing trouble in the shop.
   - Design the encounter to highlight each character's strengths and abilities, allowing them to showcase their unique skills.

3. The Proprietor's Request:
   - After the encounter, the proprietor reveals their true purpose: to recruit the characters as agents for a grand quest.
   - Explain the overarching quest or goal that forms the central narrative of the campaign and how the characters' backstories are connected to it in meaningful ways.

4. Character Hooks:
   - Provide individual plot hooks tailored to each character's backstory, goals, or motivations.
   - These hooks should offer personal stakes and incentives for the characters to embark on the grand quest and explore the campaign world.

5. Information and Guidance:
   - The proprietor shares important information about the campaign world, the main antagonist, or the current state of affairs.
   - Provide the characters with relevant knowledge, maps, or resources that can assist them on their journey.

6. Establishing Relationships:
   - Encourage the characters to interact with each other and the NPCs in the shop.
   - Foster roleplaying opportunities for the characters to develop relationships, alliances, or conflicts, helping to establish a cohesive group dynamic.

7. The Departure:
   - Conclude the session by having the proprietor open a portal or magical gateway that transports the characters from the wizard's shop to the starting location of the campaign.
   - Describe the new surroundings and atmosphere, setting the stage for their first steps into the wider world.

8. Session Recap and Feedback:
   - Take a moment to recap the key events of the session, emphasizing the characters' connections, goals, and the central quest.
   - Encourage players to provide feedback, ask questions, and share their thoughts on the session and their characters' experiences.

By following this plan, you can conduct a session that functions as the pilot episode of the "isekai" campaign, introducing the players to the campaign narrative, establishing character connections, and setting the stage for their adventures in the larger campaign world.

# Reflection

## Setting

## Profiling

I like the "exploration, combat, puzzle, roleplay" division of intent. With 4 parts, it gives me a way to tie the player types to playing card suits as well, which is one of my favorite things to reference. It also gives me a way of finding what the players prefer, and who dominates each.

There is always a social structure, even if you don't notice.

## Session Zero

- opening scene
	- what is everyone's initial normal?
	- what would make you leave? willingly or unwillingly?
- Avador's Travelling Emporium
	- The wonderous explorer searching for new oysters or transportation tech
	- secretly looking for new people, willing or not
	- All encounters happen simultaneously: prismatic jewel that splits the ship into temporary "images"

### what is the main quest? whose side do you take?

- blue dragon (secretly the missing planeswalker) who makes the light stones?
- quarantined mad biologist (lich) searching for a cure to her own infection?
- The church of fermentation trying to promote the rapid spread of the disease?
- abyssal "gnome" inhabitants from whence the pocket universe came?
	- they are only gnomes because we cannot fathom their true form
	- children and animals seem unaffected by their magic
	- they can once a day permanently change people into equivalent animals until their death breaks the curse.
	- 3 times a day they can magically distract a group of people while they escape
	- they, like dragons, are drawn to hoard what they see as valuable, often precious jewels

The dragons are allied with the wizards and the exiled lich as their figuredead, but they fight for control of the partnership.

The church of fermentation wants to overthrow the system and is mostly a population control argument in a finite space. "don't expand, distill"

The gnomes and the fey are unaligned and roam the wilderness populating the places where the bubble universe is the weakest.

The session needs a representative for each faction that gives the players an in for that narrative setting upon landing in the isekai. Whoever the players follow, if any, should serve as their allies, and the natural adversaries based on factional motivations will follow.

The gnomes are the default, and if the players leave the ship without making friends, the gnomes will find them when they land in the wilderness.

# Brainstorming

## My Desires

Using Avador's Travelling Emporium as the setting for session zero, and the gateway in and out of the "isekai" universe.

### Session Zero

- NPSs in  that can service to entice different characters based on their motives
- ship interactions or plot hooks that set the tone and power dynamics of the group
- ship interactions or plot hooks that help determine who the protagonists and antagonists in the setting are
