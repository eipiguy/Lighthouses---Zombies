A ship is travelling around full of magical objects, advertising a one-way ticket to a distant land where you can begin life anew as anything you want to be. Wonders of technology and magic have propelled us beyond tilling the soil and slaving under opressors. Join us and you too can partake of our bounty!

Draw parallels to other immigrations you know about, and try to frame it from the perspective of the ones fleeing.
- The Irish potato famine
- The numerous wars that cause people to flee with their families for their lives
- Religious persecution

I'm thinking even the start of the Americas and settlement in a new world.
