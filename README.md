# Roleplay

This is one of my more ambitious and long term ideas. I want this as a way to get into the realm of psychology, without going to directly at it. That's what all tabletop roleplaying games turn into after a few months anyway: group counseling with an unqualified peer leader. =P

I have thoughts of understanding personality with this project. Mostly my own, with an intent to preserve it so people would know my character. Who I was and how I interacted with the world after I'm gone. A sort of photo of the mind.
